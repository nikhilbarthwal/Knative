# Cloud Storage triggered service

In this sample, we'll take a look at how to connect Google Cloud Storage events
can be delivered to a service with Knative Eventing. We'll roughly be following
[CloudStorageSource
Example](https://github.com/google/knative-gcp/blob/master/docs/examples/cloudstoragesource/README.md)
docs page.

## Knative with GCP & PubSub Topic

We're assuming that you already went through [Install Knative with GCP](../setup/README.md) section of the setup.

## Init CloudStorageSource

Enable the Cloud Storage API:

```sh
gcloud services enable storage-component.googleapis.com storage-api.googleapis.com
```

Give Google Cloud Storage permissions to publish to GCP Pub/Sub.

First, find the Service Account that GCS uses to publish to Pub/Sub. Use the
steps outlined in [Cloud Console or the JSON
API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/getting-service-account) or run the
following command and check `email_address` field:

```sh
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
"https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/projects/$(gcloud config get-value project)/serviceAccount"
```

Assuming the service account you found from above was
`service-XYZ@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, run the following to
grant rights to that Service Account to publish to Pub/Sub:

```sh
export GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=service-XYZ@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value core/project)
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
  --member=serviceAccount:${GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT} \
  --role roles/pubsub.publisher
```

## Create a storage bucket

Create a unique storage bucket to save files:

```sh
export BUCKET="$(gcloud config get-value core/project)-storage"
gsutil mb gs://${BUCKET}
```

## CloudStorageSource

Create a CloudStorageSource to connect storage events to Knative Eventing. The
default
[cloudstoragesource.yaml](https://github.com/google/knative-gcp/blob/master/docs/examples/cloudstoragesource/cloudstoragesource.yaml)
connects storage events to a service directly.

Instead, use the following
[cloudstoragesource.yaml](../eventing/storage/cloudstoragesource.yaml) to
connect storage events to a Broker, so, you can have multiple triggers to invoke
multiple services on the same event.

Make sure you update the bucket name.

Create the CloudStorageSource:

```sh
kubectl apply -f cloudstoragesource.yaml
```

## Broker

Make sure there's a Broker in the default namespace by following instructions in
[Broker Creation](brokercreation.md) page.

## Consumer

For the event consumer, we can use the Event Display service defined in
[kservice.yaml](../eventing/storage/kservice.yaml).

Create the service:

```sh
kubectl apply -f kservice.yaml
```

## Trigger

Connect the Event Display service to the Broker with a Trigger defined in [trigger.yaml](../eventing/storage/trigger.yaml):

Create the trigger:

```sh
kubectl apply -f trigger.yaml
```

Check that the trigger is ready:

```sh
kubectl get trigger

NAME                           READY   REASON   BROKER    SUBSCRIBER_URI                                   AGE
trigger-event-display-storage   True             default   http://event-display.default.svc.cluster.local   95s
```

## Test the service

We can now test our service by sending a file to the bucket.

```sh
gsutil cp cloudstoragesource.yaml gs://${BUCKET}
```

Wait a little and check that a pod is created:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

Inspect the logs of the pod (replace `<podid>` with actual pod id):

```sh
kubectl logs <podid> --follow -c user-container
```

You should see something similar to this:
